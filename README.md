# Diabetes_Prediction

## Introduction 

In this project, we design a predictive model that predicts whether a patient will develop diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measures in the dataset, and explore different techniques to improve performance and accuracy. Logistic regression is the main algorithm used in this article and the analysis was
performed using Python IDEs. The trial uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## Data Sourcing

The dataset was collected from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and is available on Kaggle. It consists of several medical analyst variables and one target variable. The objective of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has diabetes. The dataset consists  of several  independent  variables   and  one  dependent  variable,  i.e.,  the  outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient  has  had their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
