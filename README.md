# Diabetes_Prediction

## Introduction 
In this project, we design a predictive model that predicts whether a patient will develop diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measures contained in the dataset, and explore different techniques to improve performance and accuracy. Logistic regression is the main algorithm used in this article and the analysis was
performed using Python IDEs. The trial  uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which is the source from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
