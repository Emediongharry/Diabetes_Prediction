# Diabetes_Prediction

## Introduction 

In this project, we design a predictive model that predicts whether a patient will develop diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measures in the dataset, and explore different techniques to improve performance and accuracy. Logistic regression is the main algorithm used in this article and the analysis was
performed using Python IDEs. The dataset was collected from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and is available on Kaggle. It consists of several medical analyst variables and one target variable. The objective of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has diabetes. The dataset consists  of several  independent  variables   and  one  dependent  variable,  i.e.,  the  outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient  has  had their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 columns. 


Below are the columns contained and their definitions:


**Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant 

**Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration  over two hours orally glucose tolerance test

**BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)


**SkinThickness:** Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)


**Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)


**BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
**DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A function that calculates the probability diabetes based on family history.
**Age:** Age in years
**Outcome:** Categorical variable (0 if not diabetic, 1 if diabetic). it is the target variable.

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analysis and visualization
4. Machine Language
5. HTML
6. Data preprocessing


## Data Cleaning
The data-cleaning process began with:
1. Importing the required libraries which included pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
2. Checking for null values. I found out that there are no null values in the dataset.
   After carefully confirming all quality issues, I concluded the data was clean and suitable for analysis.
